I’ve started learning **Power BI** and created my **first dashboard**, which focuses on **Call Center Performance**. Here's a breakdown of the key insights:  

1. **Total Calls by Topic**  
   - The dashboard shows the number of calls received for different topics, such as streaming issues, technical support, payment-related queries, contract renewals, and administrative support.  
   - The highest number of calls (382) were related to streaming issues, while administrative support had the least (325).

2. **Calls Resolved vs. Not Resolved**  
   - Out of all the calls, 1.3K were resolved successfully, while 0.5K were not resolved. This gives a clear picture of the resolution rate.

3. **Calls Answered by Agent**  
   - The pie chart provides a breakdown of how many calls each agent handled.  
   - For example, Agent 171 handled 11% of the total calls.

4. **Calls Declined by Agent**  
   - Another pie chart highlights the number of calls declined by agents, helping to identify areas where agents may need support or additional training.

5. **Sum of Call Duration by Agents**  
   - The bar chart at the bottom shows the total call duration for each agent, providing insights into workload and call handling efficiency.

6. **Average Satisfaction by Agents**  
   - Customer satisfaction is tracked for each agent, offering a performance metric beyond just call volume.  
   - The chart shows that Stewart had the highest satisfaction score (13.05%), followed by Dan and Jim.

7. **Overall Metrics**  
   - Total calls answered: 1,772  
   - Calls rejected: 317  
   - Total agents: 8  
   - Jim had the highest number of calls answered, while Stewart had the lowest.

This dashboard helped me understand how Power BI can be used to turn raw data into actionable insights, especially for operational performance.  

I’m looking forward to learning more and creating more advanced dashboards in the future. Would love to hear feedback or tips from others in the data community!
